# Welcome to the website repo for devs.
This repository is created for the entire developement process between Neocities and Github Pages. The objective is not only show an origianl website showcasing my porfolio but also an template open-source for anyone who want to experiment, dev and etc. 

## Build requirements free
You don't needs to build my repo since it's entirely website based. Only you needs to build is all the dependency you may or needs use. For this repo, it's may needs to use Material Design 3. After completing theses task, you should not have more issues when it's time to edit the page has you wish. 
High recommend to fork the project before doing any modifications on the project.
